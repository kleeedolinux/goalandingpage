**🔥 The GOA Manifest: Why We’re Done Apologizing for Simplicity**  

Developer First. Rollback Necessary. And For the Love of God, Stop Overcomplicating My To-Do App.  

GOA wasn’t built to chase trends.  
It was built because *we’re tired*.  
Tired of debugging a 20-layer React component just to center a div.  
Tired of npm installing “left-pad” and praying it doesn’t break prod.  
Tired of explaining to clients why their “simple blog” needs a Kubernetes cluster and a GraphQL schema.  

GOA is a middle finger to the circus.  
A manifesto that screams:  
> “Bro, it’s a CRUD app. Not a Mars rover.”

### 🛠️ GOA Isn’t Retro — It’s a Time Machine to Sanity  

Remember when you could *just build stuff*? Before SPA frameworks demanded you sacrifice your firstborn to the hydration gods?  

GOA throws you back to that era — but with modern perks:  
- **0 build steps** (yes, zero — save your "webpack.config.js" tears for therapy).  
- **HTML that’s HTML**, not a JSX Russian nesting doll.  
- **APIs that are .go files**, not a 400-line Express router.  
- **Tailwind without 12 dev dependencies** (it’s just CSS, folks).  

---

## 🚨 GOA is Not a Framework. It’s an Intervention.  

We’re here to stage a coup against:  
- **“Best practices”** that require a YAML file to render “Hello World”.  
- **“Production-grade”** tooling that crashes if you forget a semicolon.  
- **“Modern stacks”** where 90% of your code exists to serve the framework, not the user.

### ⚡ How It Works: Less Magic, More Results  

- **Routes?** They’re folders. *Mind-blowing, right?*  
- **Hot reload?** Save the file. Hit F5. *Congratulations, you’ve mastered GOA.*  
- **State management?** Your database. *No, really.*  

---

## 🤯 Why This Feels Illegal  

- **GOA apps boot faster than your IDE opens.**  
  (Seriously. 50ms cold starts. Go cry in your $20/month Vercel bill.)  
- **Need a new page?** Create a file. *No, we’re not joking.*  
- **jQuery?** Yeah, jQuery. It’s still here. It still works. *Your SPA didn’t need Redux either.*

### 🧠 The Secret Sauce: GOA Trusts *You*  

We don’t hide critical logic behind 17 layers of abstraction.  
- Templates are `{{ .Name }}`, not `<Suspense><ErrorBoundary><MemoizedHell />`.  
- APIs are functions, not “route handlers” buried in a `src/utils/middleware` purgatory.  
- **You own your code.** Not Next.js. Not Vite. Not The Framework of the Week.

## 💀 The Stack That Will Get You Fired (For Shipping Too Fast)  

- **Go** (because compiling a binary shouldn’t take a coffee break)  
- **HTML** (write it. ship it. watch it work.)  
- **Tailwind** (it’s utility CSS — not a cult)  
- **jQuery** (fight us)

### 🚨 Warning: GOA is Contagious  

Once you ship a feature in 10 minutes instead of 10 hours…  
Once you delete your `Dockerfile` because your app is a 5MB binary…  
Once you realize *you don’t miss React*…  

**There’s no going back.**
